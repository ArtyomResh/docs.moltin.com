# Exporting

The `jobs` endpoint provides you the ability to export orders to CSV.

{% hint style="info" %}
See [filtering](https://docs.moltin.com/orders-and-customers/orders/filtering) for the available filter types.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Once a job is created, it will return a `pending` `status`. Once a job is `complete`, you can access the file using the provided endpoint.
{% endhint %}

For more details on the endpoint, see: [Jobs](../../advanced/jobs/).
