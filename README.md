# Moltin API Reference

## Welcome to Moltin

[Moltin](https://moltin.com) is a modular, headless eCommerce API that enables experience-first commerce.

The Moltin API follows a strict microservices architecture that enables you to plug commerce into any part of your application. The API is built on the [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org/) specification, follows predictable [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) URLs and supports [cross-origin resource sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing).

We have a two-track [authentication layer](basics/authentication/) that enables destructive and non-destructive actions across projects. All requests require an accompanying `API key` that is associated to users on your team.

## SDKs

Moltin officially maintains and supports both a [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/moltin/js-sdk) and [Swift SDK](https://github.com/moltin/ios-sdk). Other SDKs are community driven but happily hosted within the [Moltin GitHub](https://github.com/moltin) organization.

## Examples

Moltin provides a variety of frontend and server-side example projects using various modern programming languages. Visit the [moltin-examples](https://github.com/moltin-examples) organization on GitHub to see more.
