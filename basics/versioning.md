# Versioning

All endpoints currently live under the `/v2` endpoint. We will not deploy any breaking changes when an endpoint is marked ready.

In the event we would need to introduce a breaking change to an endpoint, we would introduce a new path to access the affected resource, such as `/v3`.

We occasionally release new endpoints for user feedback and provide a `BETA` notice inside the API reference and [documentation](https://developers.moltin.com/docs).
