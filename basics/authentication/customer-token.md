# Customer token

Customer tokens are available for anyone using the [Customers API](../../orders-and-customers/customers/). You can associate customers to orders and addresses.

You'll want to use the `X-Moltin-Customer-Token` header with any requests that do any of the following;

* Get a Customer
* Update a Customer
* Get Customer Addresses
* Get an Address
* Create an Address
* Update an Address
* Get all Orders
* Get an Order

Read all about the customer authentication type inside of the Customers API documentation.
