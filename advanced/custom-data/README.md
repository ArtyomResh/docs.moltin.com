# Custom Data

A flow describes a collection of fields. It is named after the internal entity type you wish to associate it with. For example a flow with a slug of `products` will be applied to all product responses in your store.

A field represents a single field of data \(for example a `Product Rating`\) to be applied to an entity. All fields have a type \(`string`, `integer`, `boolean`, `date` or `relationship`\), a default value and an optional set of validation rules.

An entry is a specific instance of a flow and is associated with a specific instance of an entity \(for example, a single product\).
