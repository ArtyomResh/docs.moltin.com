# Relationships

There are 3 types of product relationships that can be created. The first allows you to organise your product catalog into [brands](../../brands/), [categories](../../categories/) and [collections](../../collections/). The second allows you to attach [files](../../../advanced/files/) and main images to your products and the third allows you to create more complex products with [variations](../../product-variations/).
